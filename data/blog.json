        "description":"In React, uncontrolled components and controlled components refer to two different approaches for managing form data in a user interface. Uncontrolled components are those where the form data is handled by the DOM itself. This means that the data is updated independently of React, and React is not aware of any changes made to the data. In uncontrolled components, event handlers are added to the DOM elements directly, and the value of the form data is accessed using refs. On the other hand, controlled components are those where the form data is handled by React. The state of the form is maintained in the state of the component, and any changes to the form data trigger a state change. Event handlers are passed down as props to the form elements, allowing React to manage the event handling and prevent any unexpected behavior. In controlled components, the value of the form data is accessed through the state of the component, making it easier to perform validation and data manipulation. In summary, the key differences between uncontrolled and controlled components are the way they handle data, state management, event handling, and value access. Controlled components provide more control and flexibility over the form data and are generally preferred in larger applications where data consistency and validation are critical. However, uncontrolled components may be simpler to implement in smaller applications with less complex data requirements."

        "thumbnail":"https://shazzad-hossen.github.io/image-host/images/blogs/blog2.png",
        "description":"PropTypes is a type-checking library in React that can be used to validate the props passed to components. By specifying the expected data type and shape of the props, PropTypes can help catch bugs and improve the reliability of the application. To use PropTypes, it's necessary to import it from the prop-types library and define the expected data type and shape of the props that a component expects. The isRequired modifier can be used to indicate that these props are mandatory, and if they are not provided or are of an incorrect data type, a warning will be logged in the console. Other PropTypes available for validation include arrayOf, bool, func, number, object, and shape. These can be used to validate more complex data types and nested data structures. Overall, using PropTypes to validate props in React can help catch errors early on in development, making it easier to maintain and extend components over time. By ensuring that the props are of the expected data type and shape, the reliability and robustness of the application can be improved."

        "description":"Node.js and Express.js are two technologies commonly used in web development for building server-side applications. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on top of the Google V8 engine and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it suitable for building scalable, high-performance applications. Node.js provides basic functionality such as file system access, network communication, and HTTP request handling. Express.js, on the other hand, is a web application framework built on top of Node.js. It provides a set of tools and features for building web applications and APIs. Express.js provides more structured and organized development approach compared to Node.js. It includes features such as routing, middleware, and templating engines that can simplify and speed up the development process. One of the key differences between Node.js and Express.js is that Node.js provides a runtime environment, while Express.js is a framework built on top of Node.js. Node.js provides basic functionality for building a server, while Express.js extends Node.js by providing additional features and tools for building web applications. In summary, Node.js and Express.js are two complementary technologies that can be used together to build powerful and scalable web applications. Node.js provides the foundation for building a server, while Express.js provides a framework to build upon that foundation and extend it with additional features and tools."

        "title":"What is a custom hook, and why will you create a custom hook?",
        "thumbnail":"https://shazzad-hossen.github.io/image-host/images/blogs/blog4.png",
        "description":"In React, a custom hook is a function that allows developers to reuse stateful logic across components. Custom hooks provide a way to extract reusable logic from components and share it between multiple components. Custom hooks are named with the prefix 'use' to indicate that they use React's built-in hooks. The logic inside a custom hook can use any of the built-in hooks provided by React, such as useState, useEffect, or useContext. Developers create custom hooks to abstract away complex logic from components and make them more reusable. For example, if there is a complex piece of logic that several components need to use, such as fetching data from an API, developers can create a custom hook that encapsulates this logic. This can simplify the code in the components that use this hook, making it more readable and easier to maintain. Another reason to create a custom hook is to create a more declarative API for working with stateful logic. Custom hooks can provide a simple and intuitive interface for working with complex stateful logic, making it easier for developers to reason about and use in their components. In summary, custom hooks are a powerful tool for reusing stateful logic across components in React. They can simplify the code in components, make it more reusable and maintainable, and provide a declarative API for working with complex stateful logic."
