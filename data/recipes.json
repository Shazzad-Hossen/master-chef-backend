Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan or pressure cooker, and let it cook for 20-25 minutes, or until the beef is tender. If using a pressure cooker, cook for 10-12 minutes. Once the beef is tender, add the shatkora wedges to the pan. Add more water if needed to cover the shatkora. Cover the pan or pressure cooker and let it cook for another 10-12 minutes or until the shatkora is tender. Add salt to taste and mix well. If you prefer a thicker curry, you can mash some of the shatkora pieces with a spoon to thicken the gravy. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve hot with steamed rice or naan.
