                "Ingredients": ["1 lb beef, cut into small cubes", "3-4 shatkora (available in South Asian grocery stores), cut into wedges", "2 onions, finely chopped", "4-5 garlic cloves, minced", "1 inch ginger, grated", "2 green chilies, slit", "1 tsp cumin powder", "1 tsp coriander powder", "1/2 tsp turmeric powder", "1/2 tsp red chili powder", "Salt, to taste", "2-3 tbsp oil", "Water, as needed", "Coriander leaves, for garnish"],
                "procedure": "Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pan or pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent. Add the minced garlic, grated ginger, and slit green chilies. Sauté for another 1-2 minutes. Add the cubed beef and mix well. Sauté for 5-6 minutes or until the beef is browned on all sides. Add the cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and red chili powder. Mix well and sauté for another 2-3 minutes. Add enough water to cover the beef and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan or pressure cooker, and let it cook for 20-25 minutes, or until the beef is tender. If using a pressure cooker, cook for 10-12 minutes. Once the beef is tender, add the shatkora wedges to the pan. Add more water if needed to cover the shatkora. Cover the pan or pressure cooker and let it cook for another 10-12 minutes or until the shatkora is tender. Add salt to taste and mix well. If you prefer a thicker curry, you can mash some of the shatkora pieces with a spoon to thicken the gravy. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve hot with steamed rice or naan. Enjoy the unique flavor of shatkora in this delicious beef curry!",
